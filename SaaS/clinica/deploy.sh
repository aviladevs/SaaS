ðŸ“‹ Next steps:
1. Upload the contents of the 'deploy' directory to your server
2. Make sure the files are served from /srv/clinica on your server
3. Configure your web server (Nginx/Apache/Caddy) to point to this directory
4. Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS

For Caddy, you can use the included Caddyfile as a reference.
